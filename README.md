# Graphics for the Modelica language specification

This repository contains files needed to generate some of the graphics used in the [specification of the Modelica language](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaSpecification).  The graphics are defined using the [Shapes language](http://lang-shapes.sourceforge.net/), and the sources are not committed to the https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaSpecification repository to reflect the still experimental status of the Shapes language.
